friendly neighborhood twitch bot

Knubot is an easy to customize twitch bot for all of your streaming needs! This project is in very early stages of development but is
still very functional! This project is being worked on in @matthewd673's free time. You can watch it being developed along with other cool things at twitch.tv/tildewave

##TODO:

planned for release ASAP:

- Command system __complete!__
- Automatic banning __complete!__
- Polling system _in active development_
- Song requests and YouTube playlists _reading up on the API_
- Shoutbox __complete!__
- Raffles _not started_
- Shoutbox queue _not started_
- Complex commands _not started_
- Move repos __this repo will be moved over to github.com/knubot/knubot in the coming days__
- Official website and documentation __this will be handled over at github.com/knubot__

##Documentation coming soon:
In the mean time, feel free to look through the code
