# knubot
friendly neighborhood twitch bot

Knubot is an easy to customize twitch bot for all of your streaming needs! This project is in very early stages of development but is
still very functional! This project is being worked on in @matthewd673's free time. You can watch it being developed along with other cool things at twitch.tv/tildewave

##TODO:
This project is very young, less than a week old at the time of writing this, so not all features are in place. We have these features
planned for release ASAP:

- Command system __complete!__
- Automatic banning __complete!__
- Polling system _(incomplete code is still in the Poll.py and Run.py classes, but it should be harmless)_
- Song requests and YouTube playlists _(difficult, anyone with experience using the YouTube API is encouraged to help)_
- Shoutbox _(easy, will probably be implemented very soon)_

##Documentation coming soon:
In the mean time, feel free to look through the code
